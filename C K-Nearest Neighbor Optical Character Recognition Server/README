protocol:

	server:
		1) daemon process creates fifo "REQUESTS" in SERVER_DIR
		2) daemon loops forever doing:
			a) read pid of client from REQUESTS fifo
			b) spawn worker process
		3) worker process creates two fifos - one for server to client communication named  <PID>_out and one for client to server communication named <PID>
		4) worker process reads in number of tests to perform
		5) for each test, worker does:
			a) read all 784 bytes of image from <PID> fifo
			b) writes nearest index and predicted label of test image to <PID>_out
		6) closes file descriptors and unlinks <PID> fifo


	client:
		1) writes PID to "REQUESTS" fifo in SERVER_DIR
		2) creates <PID> fifo if it doesn't already exist
		3) writes number of tests to be done into <PID> fifo
		4) for each test, client does:
			a) write all 784 bytes of image to <PID> fifo
			b) read predicted index and label from <PID>_out fifo
			c) print expected and predicted results if they differ
		5) prints percentage of successful classifications
		6) closes file descriptors and unlinks <PID>_out fifo
