usage: 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/cs551/lib ./knnd DATA_DIR [K]
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/cs551/lib ./knnc DATA_DIR [N_TESTS]

protocol:
	1) server opens three semaphores and shared memory with well-known names
	2) in an infinite loop, the server waits on the request semaphore
	3) the client waits on server semaphore
	4) client writes number of tests into shared memory, posts the request semaphore, then waits on the response semaphore
	5) server reads the number of tests, posts the response semaphore
	6) until all tests are completed:
		a) server waits on request semaphore
		b) client writes image bytes into shared memory, posts request semaphore, and waits on response semaphore
		c) server reads image bytes, classifies image, writes index and classification result into shared memory, and posts response semaphore 
		d) client reads index and classification result
	7) client posts the server semaphore
