The accuracy improves very slightly when we filter out stopwords. Stopwords may introduce a lot of noise into the data set because they don't tell us anything about the context or true meaning of a document. Stopwords are equally likely to be included in spam and ham documents so they are not accurate predictors of whether a document in spam or ham.
